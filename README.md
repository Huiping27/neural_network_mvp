## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a minimal viable product (MVP) for digit recognition using a neural network. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

The project is composed of two main parts:
1. **Model Training:** Training a neural network to recognize digits.
2. **Flask API:** An API to predict the digit from an uploaded image.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd neutral_network_mvp
